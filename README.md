# MachineLearning_NumericalDigitRecognition
Utilizes machine learning algorithm to train a model that recognizes handwritten numerical digits from photographs.

College Capstone Project, required in leu of an internship for graduation. For this project, I was given a task and left to my own devices to complete it. No resources
were provided. In addition to the code listed here, written proposals were submitted to stakeholders for approval including project details such as projected timelines
and budgets, along with accompanying reports. The task reflects the process (software development lifecycle) used at most mid to large size companies. 


Utilizes SVC (Support Vector Classification) algorithm in conjunction with the SciKit Learn Python library. Can be viewed as a Jupyter Notebook. Accuracy has been
verified as above 96%.
